Analysis of plasma torch data

We produce spectra from feeding various samples into a plasma torch. The samples are mixed in real time and fed into the sample chamber. **DETECTOR DATA TO FOLLOW**. The goal of this project is to produce a neural network classifier to identify the components of the plasma feed material from the input spectra.

# ToDo
- [ ] Make data files that match our spectra containing which Analytes were present
- [ ] Develop input processing for our spectra files (slice out metadata, determine which columns are needed)
- [ ] Pair input and output data sets
- [ ] Input processing and normalization (PCA?)
