## Calibration data

This folder contains calibration curves taken in 4 circumstances: 
- the ones with "-Background_" in the filename are with the cable and light connected, but with the shutter closed
- "-Deuterium_" is with the deuterium setting on the cal lamp
- "-DeuteriumHalogen_" is with both sources in the cal lamp
- "-Halogen_" is with just the halogen source connected

There are two other files: 
- "CalibrationFile.txt" is the calibration output from the ocean optics software
- "fiber_response_curve.txt" is a scan/DataThief of the fiber response that Ocean Optics provided with the calibration lamp. Theoretically it should already be built into the calibration curves above, since that fiber was used...
